### **Getting Started**
Follow these steps to set up the Prayer Progress Tracker on your local machine.

#### **1. Prerequisites**
- Install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) or any other PHP server.
- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
- Clone the repository.

#### **2. Clone Repository**
```bash
git clone git@github.com:abdulsalambarghouthi/prayer.git
cd prayer
```

#### **3. Database Setup**
- Create a database in MySQL (e.g., `prayer_tracker`).
- Run the following SQL query to create the required table:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE prayer_logs (
      id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
      prayer_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
      prayer_date DATE NOT NULL,
      status ENUM('completed', 'missed') NOT NULL,
      user_id INT NOT NULL
  );
  ```

#### **4. Configure the Application**
- Update your database credentials in the PHP files (`save_prayer.php`, `get_data.php`):
  ```php
  $host = "localhost";
  $user = "root";
  $password = "";
  $database = "prayer_tracker";
  ```

#### **5. Run the Application**
- Start your PHP server (e.g., using XAMPP).
- Open the application in your browser at `http://localhost/prayer`.
